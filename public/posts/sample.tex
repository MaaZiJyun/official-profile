\section{Introduction}
This is a sample LaTeX document intended to test client-side conversion to HTML using latex.js. It includes a title, sections, and some simple text. Math like $E=mc^2$ is inline and should be handled.

\section{Background}
LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for scientific documents. This sample demonstrates a simple workflow where the raw .tex file is fetched by the browser and converted to HTML using a JS LaTeX renderer.

\section{Conclusion}
This is only a demo. For production use you may prefer server-side conversion (Pandoc, TeX→HTML) or prebuilt PDFs.
